holly jolly x-mas :---)

We're alternating between Rust and Go after each day~

Even days -> Go

Odd days -> Rust

### Running the solutions

Add the number of the day you want to run as the first argument when running the solution.

Each solution has two input files ending in either "p" or "j". Add its letter as the last argument when running the solution.

#### Rust

```
> cd rust
> cargo run [day number] [p j]

Example:
> cargo run 1 p
```

#### Go

```
> cd go
> go run . [day number] [p j]

Example:
> go run . 2 j
```
