holly jolly x-mas :---)

We're alternating between Rust and Go after each day~

### Running the solutions

Each solution has two input files ending in either "p" or "j". To choose which one to use, simply add its letter as an argument when running the solution.

To choose the solution for a specific day, uncomment the corresponding line in the main file.

#### Rust

```
> cd rust
> cargo run [p j]
```

#### Go

```
> cd go
> go run . [p j]
```
